# STUDENT-PERFORMANCE-ANALYSIS-FOR-THE-YEAR-2023
This Analysis is aimed to look into the student over all performance for the year and give insight to why there is a drop in performance and give recommendations on how to improve performance.


INSIGHTS:

• The average attention level of students is at 54%, suggesting that almost half of the students may not be fully engaged in their studies.
This level of attention could impact students’ overall academic performance, especially in subjects requiring higher engagement.

 

• There are 145 students in total, with 60% being male and 40% female.
Understanding this gender distribution is important when creating gender-specific support programs or initiatives to promote academic performance.

 
• The majority of students (76) have 50% scholarships, followed by 42 students with 75% scholarships, and 23 with 25% scholarships. Only 3 students have full scholarships, and 1 student has no scholarship.


A significant portion of students has partial financial support, which may motivate them to maintain or improve their grades to retain their scholarships.


• A majority of students (99) read sometimes, while 27 students report not reading at all, and only 19 students read often.


This limited reading frequency could impact their ability to understand course material in-depth and could affect performance on exams and assignments.

 

RECOMMENDATIONS:


• Incorporate more interactive teaching techniques, such as group discussions, project-based learning, and interactive technology, to boost attention and engagement in classes.
Implement reward systems, such as extra credit or participation points, to encourage students to actively participate and pay attention in class.

 

Educate students on the importance of consistent study hours. Encourage at least 6-10 hours per week for optimal results, as studying less than 5 hours per week is likely insufficient.

Establish study groups to encourage collaboration and provide a structured approach to studying. This can be particularly helpful for students who struggle to study independently.

Conduct workshops on time management and productivity, as effective time management is essential for balancing study hours with other activities. Such workshops could help students allocate sufficient time to study and improve overall academic performance.

• Implement a system of regular performance feedback so that students can track their progress and make improvements throughout the semester. Providing personalized feedback based on their GPA and attention levels could be highly beneficial.
